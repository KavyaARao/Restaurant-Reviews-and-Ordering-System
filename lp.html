I visit this place and end up picking up a few stuff everytime I pass by.<br>Their sea and salt macroons and red velvet cup cakes are truly amazing. <br>You must this place atleast once if you're a dessert lover and have an occasional craving for your sweet tooth.</li> <li> It is a very small place with hardly any seating area! The ambience is very cute! <br>They have a good range and variety of macaroons, brownies and muffins! Chocolate macaroons and the nutella brownie is my favourite </li></ul> </center></body></html>
