Offering Asian cuisine Chap Chay has a stir fry station.</li><br> <li>The greatest draw of this Chinese-tilting Pan-Asian restaurant is a make-your-own stir fry counter. Prepped meat and vegetables are neatly laid out for you to stack into bowls. <br>Fill out a flavour-card or leave it to the Chef. Chap Chay sports a smartly appointed Oriental air that is just about loose enough for the DIY action</li></ul> </center></body></html>
