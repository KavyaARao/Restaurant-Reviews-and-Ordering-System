This is the place to be.<br> Just sit and savor yummy food and your drink, at your pace.<br> They have a wide spread across Italian, continental, Indian and more. You'll go crazy over the desserts!<br> The staff are so sweet, they even did a dance for the guests! Pleasantly surprised. They have 2 levels of seating.<br> The ambience, though low lit, but lovely help you relax. A must go. And a must repeat.</li><br> <li>A lovely place to enjoy scrumptious food. The staff are very polite and hospitable.<br> A little pricey but worth the money spent.<br> You will leave the place with a satisfied tummy.<br> All the dishes were cooked to perfection.<br> A very special mention to the courteous staff again!</li></ul> </center></body></html>
