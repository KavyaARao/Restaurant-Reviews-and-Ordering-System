Definitely get the nutella sea salt cookie topped with ice cream and chocolate sauce.<br>The smores cookies and dark chocolate was insane as well. <br>The hot chocolate was okay could have had more depth and body to it.</li> <li>Crazy good place! I tried 6 of their cookies and all of them were a hit.<br>I do think they're extremely expensive at about 160 bucks on average per cookies but I think they're really really good for indulging once in a while. </li></ul> </center></body></html>
